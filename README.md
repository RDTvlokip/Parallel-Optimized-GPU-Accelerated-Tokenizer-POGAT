# **Parallel Optimized GPU-Accelerated Tokenizer (POGAT)**

## Description

The **Parallel Optimized GPU-Accelerated Tokenizer (POGAT)** is an ultra-fast tokenizer designed to perform text encoding and decoding calculations in parallel, leveraging GPU capabilities to maximize performance. This tokenizer is specifically designed for applications requiring high-speed encoding and decoding, such as training language models and processing large-scale text data.

## Features

- **GPU Optimization**: Utilizes the power of GPUs to accelerate the encoding and decoding processes.
- **Fast Encoding**: Exceptional encoding performance, reaching speeds up to 8,154 characters per second.
- **Ultra-Fast Decoding**: Decoding speed reaching millions of characters per second (8,701,668 characters/s).
- **Parallel Optimization**: Executes tasks in parallel to maximize speeds on GPU-enabled systems.
- **Easy Integration**: Easy to integrate into AI or natural language processing projects.

## Performance Tests

Here are the performance test results for POGAT:

### Test 1: Text length = 17,400 characters
- **Encoding Time**: 2.1338 seconds
- **Encoding Speed**: 8,154.33 characters/second
- **Decoding Time**: 0.0020 seconds
- **Decoding Speed**: 8,701,668.01 characters/second

### Test 2: Text length = 104,900 characters
- **Encoding Time**: 13.3521 seconds
- **Encoding Speed**: 7,856.46 characters/second
- **Decoding Time**: 0.0110 seconds
- **Decoding Speed**: 9,534,781.44 characters/second

### Performance Stats:
- **CPU Usage**: 19.3%
- **RAM Used**: 51.48 MB
- **GPU Used**: 1.81 GB out of 11.00 GB (16.4%) **Note:** Roblox was running in the background, so this is not the full usage of the GPU by POGAT alone! ðŸ˜†

And guess what? **Roblox** was running at the same time! ðŸ˜Ž This incredible performance was achieved even while the game was running. Imagine the power of POGAT! ðŸ’¥

These performances may vary depending on the hardware and GPU configuration used.
