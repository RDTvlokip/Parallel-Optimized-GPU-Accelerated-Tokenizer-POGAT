# **Parallel Optimized GPU-Accelerated Tokenizer (POGAT)**

## Description

The **Parallel Optimized GPU-Accelerated Tokenizer (POGAT)** is an ultra-fast tokenizer designed to perform text encoding and decoding calculations in parallel, leveraging GPU capabilities to maximize performance. This tokenizer is specifically designed for applications requiring high-speed encoding and decoding, such as training language models and processing large-scale text data.

## Features

- **GPU Optimization**: Utilizes the power of GPUs to accelerate the encoding and decoding processes.
- **Fast Encoding**: Exceptional encoding performance, reaching speeds up to 8,154 characters per second.
- **Ultra-Fast Decoding**: Decoding speed reaching millions of characters per second (8,701,668 characters/s).
- **Parallel Optimization**: Executes tasks in parallel to maximize speeds on GPU-enabled systems.
- **Easy Integration**: Easy to integrate into AI or natural language processing projects.
